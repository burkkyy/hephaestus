# hephaestus documentation

Most of info here will be for quick look up while developing, or notes to reference to get a quick refresher.

I'm still working out how I will write documentation, but I will try to keep it to the same format as [template.md](doc/template.md)

## Disclaimer

The project is in a very early dev phase, so a good amount of the documentation will be out of date.
